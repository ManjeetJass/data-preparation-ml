 <h3>Data preparation for Machine Learning</h3>
The raw data we get directly from sources is rarely in the format that we use to perform analysis on. The goal of data preparation is to create the data that will be used for analysis. There are many types of data quality issues, including missing values, duplicate data, inconsistent or invalid data, noise, and outliers. Please check examples for handling these issues.
